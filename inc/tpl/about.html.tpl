            <p>
            Our WordPress Security Plugin will monitor your site from the inside, creating
            a complete audit trail, alerting you of possible security issues (file changes,
            password guessing attacks, etc) and blocking the attackers. This is the perfect
            complement for our external security scans.

            This feature compares your core install against a clean version of core. In other
            words, if it is not a 1-to-1 match with core you will be notified of a problem.
            Future add-ons include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Theme Integrity Checks</li>
                <li>Plugin Integrity Checks</li>

            <p>
            This feature is great for proactive webmasters who want to monitor their website
            to ensure no unauthorized access or changes are made without prior approval.
            Monitor your site for changes. This feature monitors for a large number of actions,
            including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Login attempts</li>
                <li>New Posts</li>

        <h3>1-Click Hardening</h3>
        <div class="inside">
            <p>
            In our experience a high-percentage of the infections we see every day come from
            poor management on the end-userâ€™s part. This feature uses common hardening
            measures that can be taken at any time and helps reduce infection risk. This
            feature performs the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Checks software core version</li>
                <li>Hides your version (security through obscurity)</li>
                <li>Upload directory protected</li>
                <li>Secret keys and salts created</li>
                <li>Configuration file hardening/location verification</li>
                <li>Hardening of readme file</li>
                <li>PHP verification</li>
            </ul>
